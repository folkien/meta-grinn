# The section below is designed to match with packagegroup-boot, but doesn't depend on it to allow for more freedom 
# when writing image recipes.
# It also avoids the choice between connman/networkmanager/ifupdown since that is an image feature, not a
# distro feature.
#
# Util-linux (u)mount is included because the busybox one can't handle /etc/mtab being symlinked to /proc/mounts
#

#
# The following section is split in 3:
#   1) Machine features: kernel modules and userspace helpers for those
#   2) Distro features: packages associated with those
#   3) Nice to have: packages that are nice to have, but aren't strictly needed
